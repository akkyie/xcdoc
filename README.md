# xcdoc

Command-line explorer for the documentation included with Xcode. `xcdoc` lets you list the documentation hierarchy, search symbols instantly, and render any article as Markdown, all without launching Xcode.

`xcdoc` works fully offline and read-only on the Xcode installed on your machine.

## Requirements
- macOS 13 or later
- Xcode 15 or later

The Xcode version used by `xcdoc` is determined by `xcode-select -p`.
You can change it with `xcode-select -s path/to/Xcode.app`, or override by setting the `DEVELOPER_DIR` environment variable when running the command:

```sh
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode-26.0.0.app/Contents/Developer xcdoc search liquid glass
```

`xcdoc` relies on Xcode's internal formats and may (likely will) break with future Xcode releases.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akkyie/xcdoc.git
cd xcdoc
swift build -c release
cp .build/release/xcdoc /usr/local/bin # or anywhere in the $PATH
```

### [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint)
```bash
mint install akkyie/xcdoc@main
```

## Usage
```bash
xcdoc <command> [options]
```

### List categories
Shows the documentation hierarchy.
```bash
xcdoc list
```

### Search keywords
Full-text search across Swift, Objective-C, and other generic documents using the offline index files.

```bash
xcdoc search String
xcdoc search --swift View
xcdoc search app life cycle
```

### Show an article as Markdown
Accepts a documentation path found via `xcdoc list` or `xcdoc search`.
```bash
xcdoc show /documentation/uikit/uiview
```

## Development
- Build: `swift build`
- Run: `swift run xcdoc <command>`
- Tests: `swift test`
